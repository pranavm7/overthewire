# 💡 Getting started

## Welcome to my [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) Walkthrough 🌐

Hey there! I’m glad you found your way here. If you’re curious about cybersecurity and don’t know where to start, you’re in the right place. My name’s [Pranav Mahajan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranav-m7), and I created this site to share writeups, tips, and tricks that I wish I had when I started. This site focuses on OverTheWire wargames—an incredible collection of challenges that introduced me to the world of ethical hacking and network security.

### Who’s This For?

If you’re just beginning your journey into cybersecurity or trying to get hands-on experience with Linux, networking, or web security, these writeups are for you. No experience? No problem. My goal is to break down each challenge and give you the foundational knowledge you need to succeed.

### What’s [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)?

OverTheWire is a platform that hosts a series of wargames—structured cybersecurity challenges that help you learn by doing. Think of it as a playground where you can practice your skills without any risk. From basic Linux navigation in Bandit to cryptography challenges in Krypton, OverTheWire has something for everyone, no matter your skill level. Additionally, you can chat with them directly \[[here](https://overthewire.org/information/chat.html)].

### Why This Site?

When I started, I found a lot of technical jargon and cryptic hints, which made things tougher. I wanted to create a resource that explains the basics in a beginner-friendly, step-by-step way. Here, you'll find simple explanations, annotated code, and practical insights to help you understand each level and, hopefully, spark your curiosity about cybersecurity.

So, whether you’re looking to solve your first OverTheWire level or just curious about how hackers think, dive in! I hope these writeups make things easier for you and help you build a solid foundation for your cybersecurity journey.

! IMPORTANT !

Kindly note that these are walk through tutorials of the challenges available. Meaning that they will provide you with a direct solution and my thought process behind it, kindly do not mistake it with hints, but rather an explanation of my approach.

Additionally, in order to adhere to OverTheWire's (OTW) code of conduct, I won't be showing passwords, only the methodology

As always, "Try Harder".

Happy hacking!
