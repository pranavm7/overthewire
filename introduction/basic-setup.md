# ðŸ“š Basic Setup

### :desktop: My setup

{% hint style="info" %}
Note:

Although I'm simply sharing my machine details here, this is by no means a requirement. Simply having a machine that can run the `ssh` command will do!
{% endhint %}

I'm currently running [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) as my OS of choice, virtualized in VMWare hosted on Windows 11. I've customized it over the years but the most important facts are below:

* A [shared folder](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Workstation-Pro/17/com.vmware.ws.using.doc/GUID-D6D9A5FD-7F5F-4C95-AFAB-EDE9335F5562.html) between my VM and my host.
* 20 GB (32 total) of dedicated RAM
* VM connected to the :globe\_with\_meridians: via a bridged network
* `[REDACTED]`  :P

### ðŸ›³ Recommendations

Setting up a VM can be time consuming but highly rewarding, I'd definitely recommend doing so, but if you'd like some quick wins, I would recommend using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) on Windows! You should be able to make decent progress.

As I don't own a mac system, it would be difficult for me to make suggestions, however I believe it does come with ssh out-of-the-box, which would effectively help you make decent progress!

Catch you on the next page! :wave:



Happy Hacking!
